      "Kerling Farm was established in 1952 by Henrik and Martha Kerling, immigrants who brought with them Old World farming traditions and a deep respect for the land. What began as a small dairy operation has evolved into a diverse, certified organic farm spanning 50 acres of Vermont's beautiful countryside.",
      "Today, the farm is managed by the third generation of Kerlings, who have expanded the operation to include organic vegetables, heritage fruit orchards, and sustainable livestock. In 2010, we opened our doors to agritourism, converting historic farm buildings into comfortable guest accommodations and developing educational programs that connect visitors with the source of their food.",
      "Our mission is simple: practice regenerative agriculture that improves soil health, support biodiversity, and share the joy of farm life with visitors seeking authentic experiences. We believe that understanding where food comes from creates more mindful consumers and helps preserve small-scale, sustainable farming for future generations.",
      "Whether you're here to relax in peaceful surroundings, learn about organic farming, or give your children hands-on experiences with nature, Kerling Farm offers a warm welcome and genuine hospitality rooted in our agricultural heritage."
